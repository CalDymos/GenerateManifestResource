# GenerateManifestResource
PureBasic tool that generates and embeds a Windows RT_MANIFEST resource (Resource.rc + Data_1.bin) with Per-Monitor DPI Aware v2 support. Designed for PureBasic IDE workflows: run via External Tools trigger before build, then include the generated .rc in Compiler Options → Resources.
